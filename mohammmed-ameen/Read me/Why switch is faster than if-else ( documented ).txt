--Why we start by index 0 in the array   ( documented )?

the switch statement is faster in most cases when compared to if-else ,
but significantly faster only when the number of conditions is large.
The primary difference in performance between the two is that the incremental cost of
an additional condition is larger for if-else than it is for switch .
