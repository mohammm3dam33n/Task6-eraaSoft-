--Why we start by index 0 in the array   ( documented )?

Origin. Martin Richards, creator of the BCPL language (a precursor of C),
 designed arrays initiating at 0 as the natural position to start accessing the array contents in the language,
 since the value of a pointer p used as an address accesses the position p + 0 in memory.
